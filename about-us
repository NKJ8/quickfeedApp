Mission:
Our mission is to make sure every consumer’s voice reach the Businesses so that they the Businesses can improve and offer better services. It is also to make sure consumer gets to choose the right services based on the feedbacks from fellow consumers. 


QuickFeed is a social networking site where consumers get to know more about their Service providers and Service providing business get to know more about what their consumers think about their services. In Quickfeed, we provide a platform where Consumers can post reviews and give feedbacks to their Service providers. The main idea behind building this project is to provide a platform where the Service providers/Businesses can get a chance to see how their products/services are impacting the lives of consumers. Using our Platform, Consumers can let the Service Providers know how well they are doing and provide suggestions on what can be improved. Now Service providers got a chance where they can analyze how well their services/products are doing in the market and they can act accordingly. Service providers can also response back to the customer’s Feedback and address any concerns the consumer is having. We will deliver an acknowledgement about the business owner/service provider based on the feedback from their consumers. Based on the Feedback Consumers get to decide which product/service to choose from and can place an order/book a service via our platform. We provide personalized suggestions to the consumer showing the best products/ services in their area. We are offering a way where a service provider can get to know feedback of their customers and promote their businesses.
